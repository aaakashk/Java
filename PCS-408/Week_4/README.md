#### [ZigZag Array](zigzag.java)

Printing an array in a ZigZag fashion. Suppose you were given an array of integers, and you are told to sort the integers in a zigzag pattern. In general, in a zigzag pattern, the first integer is less than the second integer, which is greater than the third integerm, which is less than the fourth integer, and so on. Hence, the converted array should be in the form of e<sub>1</sub> < e<sub>2</sub> > e<sub>3</sub> < e<sub>4</sub> > e<sub>5</sub> < e<sub>6</sub>.

**Test Cases:**

**Test Case 1:**

- **Input:**<br>7<br>4 3 7 8 6 2 1

- **Output:**<br>3 7 4 8 2 6 1

**Test Case 2:**

- **Input:**<br>4<br>1 4 3 2

- **Output 2:**<br>1 4 2 3

#### [Arrange an Array](arrange_array.java)

The problem to rearrange positive and negative numbers in an array.<br>
**Method:** This approach moves all negative numbers to the beginning and positive numbers to the end but does not change the order of appearance of the elements of the array.

**Test Case:**

- **Input:** 1 -1 2 -2  3 -3
- **Output:** -1 -2 -3 1 2 3
