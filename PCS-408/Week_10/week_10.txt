1. Write a program to calculate area of rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class Shape with 3 abstract methods namely, rectangleArea() taking 2 parameters length and breadth, squareArea() and circleArea() taking 1 parameter each.
Now create another class Area containing all the three methods for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class Area and call all the 3 methods.
2. Write a program to implement abstract class and abstract method with following details -
	Create an abstract base class Temperature -
		Data Members - double temp
		Method Members - void setTempData(double)
				abstract void changeTemp()
	Subclass - Fahrenheit
		Data Members - double cTemp
		Method Members - override abstract method changeTemp() to convert the Fahrenheit temperature into degree Celsius by using formula C = 5 / 9 * (F - 32)
	Subclass - Celsius 
		Data Members - double fTemp
		Method Members - override abstract method changeTemp() to convert the Celsius temperature into degree Fahrenheit by using formula F = C * 9 / 5 + 32
3. Write a program to create an interface that consists of method to display volume() as an abstract method and redefine this method in the derived class to suit their requirements. Make classes called Cone, Hemisphere and Cylinder that implements the interface. Using these three classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of cone, hemisphere and cylinder and display the volumes.
