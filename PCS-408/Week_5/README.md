#### [Saddle Point Co-ordinates](Matrix.java)

Program to find the saddle point co-ordinates in a given matrix. A saddle point is an element of the matrix, which is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column.

**Example:** Consider the matrix given below:<br>
Matrix[3][3]<br>
1 2 3<br>
4 5 6<br>
7 8 9<br>

Here, 7 is the saddle point because it is the minimum element in its row and maximum element in its column.

#### [Pattern Matching](RegularExpression.java)

Program to find all the patterns of **0(1+)0** in the given string. Given a string containing 0's and 1's, find the total number of **0(1+)0** pattern in the string and output it.

**Example:**

**Input:** 01101111010

**Output:** 3

**Matched strings:**<br>
**0110**1111010<br>
011**011110**10<br>
01101111**010**<br>
